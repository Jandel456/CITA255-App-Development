Do you know what the Pomodoro Technique is?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method in which you do focused work during 25-minute intervals — known as Pomodoros — and take a five-minute break.
You can change the numbers around if you want, as long as you hold yourself accountable.
Now that you understand what the Pomodoro method is and more importantly what a Pomodoro is, feel free to use this app to help you stay focused!
